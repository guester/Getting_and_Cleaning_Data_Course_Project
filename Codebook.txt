Codebook:

The first variable has the name "subject_id" and contains unique subject identifiers for the 30 subjects in the data set (1-30).

The second variable has the name "activity" and contains one of six activity descriptions (WALKING
, WALKING_UPSTAIRS
, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
, SITTING
, STANDING
, LAYING)

The remaining variable names are all derived from the features.txt file.  The feature labels in this file contained many abbreviations.  In order to obtain more 
turn these labels into descriptive variable names, each abbreviation was expanded to the full-length form e.g. "Acc" was expanded to "Acceleration" and "std" was
expanded to "standard deviation" etc.

The final tidy data set contains the mean value of the original variables grouped by subject_id and activity.  Therefore, for the final data set all of the variables
variable names (excluding subject_id and activity) were modified to begin with the character string "mean of".
