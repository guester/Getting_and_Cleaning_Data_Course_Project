Codebook:

The first variable in this dataset has the name "subject_id" and contains unique subject identifiers for the 30 
subjects in the data set (1-30).

The second variable in this dataset has the name "activity" and contains one of six activity descriptions (WALKING,
WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

The remaining variable names are all derived from the features.txt file.  The feature labels in this file contained many
abbreviations.  In order to turn these labels into more descriptive variable names, each abbreviation was expanded
to the full-length form e.g. "Acc" was expanded to "Acceleration" and "std" was expanded to "standard deviation" etc.

The final tidy dataset contains the mean value of the original variables grouped by subject_id and activity.  Therefore,
for this final dataset all of the variable names (excluding subject_id and activity) were modified to begin with the
character string "mean of".
